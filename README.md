# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
<h1> E-comm website </h2>
This is a responsive e-commerce website built with a focus on product display and filtering. Please note that the site is currently under construction and isn't fully optimized for all devices, particularly mobile and tablet views.

<h2>Features </h2>
1. Product Grid Section: The core product display is functional. You can view all available products in a grid layout.
<br>
2. Filtering: The product filters are working correctly. You can refine your search based on various criteria (e.g., category, price, brand).
<br>
3. Sorting: The sorting functionality is active, allowing you to reorder products by different attributes (e.g., price low-to-high, newest).
<br>
4. Responsiveness: The product grid, filters, and sorting are all responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.
<br>
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
1. Mobile and Tablet Optimization: The overall layout and user experience are not yet fully optimized for smaller screens. Some elements may appear out of place or not be easily accessible.
<br>
2. Under Construction: This is a work in progress. Expect to find incomplete pages, broken links, or placeholder content.
<br>

I would appreciate it if you could take a look at the product grid section, specifically testing the filters and sorting. Your feedback on these features would be very helpful.
